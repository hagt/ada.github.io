[![Image Advene](advene.png "Annotations in Advene")](advene.png)

Throughout the project, the FU Berlin project team created a very high quality data set of manual film-analytical annotations for a set of feature films, documentaries, and television news. These valuable annotations are published here as Linked Open Data under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license to make the data available to other film scientists as well as researchers from other domains.


### Annotation Creation

The annotations were created based on a film scholar's analytical framework to study the aesthetics of audio-visual images. The annotation work followed a strict annotation routine to precicely describe the movies of the [corpus](/corpus) under different levels of description (see [ontology](/ontology)).
